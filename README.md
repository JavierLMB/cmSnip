## **cmSnip App**

cmSnip is a flexible content management system (CMS) designed to help teams efficiently manage code snippets and templates. Developers can build dynamic templates that non-technical users can easily populate, making it an ideal tool for collaborative content creation between technical and non-technical team members.
